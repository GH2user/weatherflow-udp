This is a driver for weewx, that captures data from the WeatherFlow bridge via
the bridge's UDP broadcasts on the local subnet.

Currently only tested with the WeatherFlow "Air" sensor array, since the "Sky"
is not available for testing yet as of 9/5/2017.

I believe that I have correctly followed the instructions provided by weewx
in order to provide the complete weewx extension package layout here.

https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/extensions#how-to-install-an-extension

Installation should be as simple as grabbing a .ZIP download of this
entire project from the GitHub web interface, and then running this
command:

wee_extension --install weatherflow-udp-version-X.Y.zip

Worst case, a manual install is simple enough.  At least on my Raspberry Pi,
copy weatherflowudp.py from bin/user to /usr/share/weewx/user/weatherflowudp.py,
and then edit /etc/weewx/weewx.conf and add the new station driver settings
per the above file.

Please let me know if I made a mistake with the packaging.  I am not a weewx
expert, and do not claim to be a programmer or more than a casual user of GitHub.
