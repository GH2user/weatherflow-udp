* Scrapped just about everything below and started over more or less from scratch.
* Multiple sensors and a sensor_map facility based on mwall's weewx-SDR syntax finally added.
* Did I mention that it is imperative that you edit your weewx.conf file and add the needed sensor_map definitions, or else weewx will collect/log NOTHING?  The readme file is worth a read.
* As far as I know, *every* sensor reading and item is passed up to weewx, with the exception of certain debugging packets that are not documented and being sent for WeatherFlow's developers to troubleshoot.
* Current as of the Hub firmware v35 protocol API documentation, tested against v37 with no identified issues.
* I have accomplished everything that I originally set out to develop, with the exception of extending the weewx database to store lightning data.  Thus, this has been committed as a true v1.00 and is labeled as the master branch.  Consider all older versions deprecated.

* Cleaned up Sky support, based on published API clarifications.
* (Note that rainfall in each packet is total since last packet, not storm/daily total. weewx likes it this way :-) and no need to delta.)
* Still does NOT look at Air/Sky device serial numbers, so it blindly reports ANY obs_air and obs_sky packets.
* Note that this 0.30 code has been running continuously on my Raspberry Pi for over a month in a test weewx instance with no problems/crashes observed.

* Initial release
* Does NOT look at Air serial number, so it will blindly report ANY obs_air packet from any associated Air sensor arrays.
* Sky packets are developed from API documentation, not tested.  Unsure if rainfall is mm, or cumulative vs. observation period.
