* Initial release
* Does NOT look at Air serial number, so it will blindly report ANY obs_air packet from any associated Air sensor arrays.
* Sky packets are developed from API documentation, not tested.  Unsure if rainfall is mm, or cumulative vs. observation period.

0.30  2017-12-03 by Arthur Emerson, vreihen@yahoo.com
* Cleaned up Sky support, based on published API clarifications.
* (Note that rainfall in each packet is total since last packet, not storm/daily total.)
* Still does NOT look at Air/Sky device serial numbers, so it blindly reports ANY obs_air and obs_sky packets.
* Note that this 0.30 code has been running continuously on my Raspberry Pi in a test weewx instance with no problems/crashes observed.
